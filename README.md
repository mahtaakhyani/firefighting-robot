AVR ATMega32 IR sensor-based robot for fire detection and suppression


This project is officially for 2015, done as a yearly school project. There were also other contributes as well.

The program is written in C . It receives analog data from IR sensors on the robot and intreprets it based on the pre-defined range to determine whether the robot is approaching fire.
When the fire is detected, mechanical system is triggered to suppress the fire by putting a cover on it.
